## About the Project

This was a challenge I took as part of a DEV training program I'm participating.

The challenge's main goal was to test my Javascript skills as well as my HTML/CSS understanding.

This is a To-do List App made for the user to keep track of all their tasks of the day. Checking all of the list items as they complete them.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## Tools I used

- Microsoft Visual Studio Code
- Git/Github
- Vercel

## Languages used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Referred Assets

The task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. There is both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

All the required assets for the challenge are in the `/images` folder, except for "project-ready-desktop.png" and "project-ready-mobile.PNG", these last images are finalized project.
